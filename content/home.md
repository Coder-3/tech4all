## Our vision and motto

To empower talents in 3rd world countries by increasing their access to in-demand tech knowledge, improving livability standards and giving motivated individuals a better chance at achieving success in life. 
The premise
The need for software in the world is rapidly increasing while the tools to build it become more available, open-source and easy to learn. It is now possible to learn to code and build software products for free and follow up by launching a commercial software within a time frame of between 6-12 months if working full time with a team of like minded individuals.

## How it works and what we offer

We are aiming for adults who:-
Pass our basic interview test as we provide them resources and guides on learning how to code
Establish an agreement with them where we will start accelerating the rate at which they are able to build the product by providing them with in-depth guides on the tech stack they need to use, mentorship and money to start working full-time and treat this venture as an actual job.
While they build the desired product, we will be checking in regularly to help them work through problems, come up with more ideas and make sure they are on the right track. We will follow a ‘money-per-milestone’ model where we see whether the artifacts produced by them are valuable and only if their clients are happy with their progress, they are given the next round of funding as required.
Once the product launches and if successful in solving the problem, we take a cut of profits from the generated revenue .
The End Goal
The problem that teams will be solving will be for a very specific subset of people. We will try to provide optimized and tailored solutions for this target group. This will reduce the rate of the failure due to the niche nature of the problem. Companies won't be required to hire additional staff which reduces management complexities.
With more poor people making lots of money, they will be able to share this with their family and indirectly improve many other people’s lives as well. With them spending more money, they are indirectly maturing their local community’s economy. 
“If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. If you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.” We are making sure everyone is being given knowledge on how to build micro startups and we hopefully wish to instill lessons in everyone as to how they can utilize their new problem-solving, communication and collaboration skills in their future jobs and professional career. 
We hope to ripple the effects of the program and create more individuals who are motivated to share their experiences and new found knowledge to build a better future for the next generation.
