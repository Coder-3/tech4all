We can make use of software created by our Founders within the Tech4All ecosystem. For example, if one of our Founders is building a note-taking application, we can recommend our Learners to utilise the app for their learning. Furthermore, we can fork the code and integrate features directly in our edu-tech platform.

Tech4All gets to benefit from the features of the Founder's software. Furthermore, it makes us more familiar with the Founder's product which increases our ability to provide feedback.

The benefit for Founders is that they get early users and feedback. If we integrate the features directly into the Tech4All platform, we can even build features that suit our needs which we can provide to Founders to potentially integrate into their software.

We can potentially take interoperability further as we encourage Founders to use each other's software, up to direct code-level integrations (sharing whole features).

Because there is a strong alignment between Founders+Tech4All, interoperability builds feedback loops:

As we help Founders, they get better outcomes. Tech4All benefits from improved Founder outcomes which in turn improves our ability to help Founders which further improves their outcomes.

Similarly, as Founders get better outcomes, they are better able to help other Founders which nests an additional feedback loop.
