<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We are a world of ideas, but not enough of them come into fruition. As much as we have noticed that the education system is changing, we want to give the less fortunate a chance to learn, churn and earn, all while dedicating themselves to creating their very own software as a service startup. We are just here to assist them along their journey.

Unfortunately, there are a lot of unrecognised, talented people across the globe. 
Most of which, live in underdeveloped regions with very basic living standards. 
We plan to target these individuals and educate them on the basics of technology, design and business concepts, so they can create their very own startup with our help.
Anyone with a device, internet connection and willingness to learn courses across 6 months are eligible. It’s as simple as that!
